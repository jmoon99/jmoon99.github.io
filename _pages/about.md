My research investigates the computational principles that enable the visual system to build robust spatiotemporal representations, ranging from stereoscopic depth to predictive motion processing. I use a combination of psychophysics, eye tracking, machine learning, and EEG to explore how environmental statistics and physical constraints shape our neural processing. My current research interest is to define the computational framework that characterizes how sensory processing is constrained by the foveal and stereoscopic systems and simultaneously modulated by cognitive states such as attention and expectation.

I am a PhD candidate in Psychology at Northeastern University, working with [Peter Bex](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/peter-bex/). Previously, I worked as a post-master's researcher in [Joonyeol Lee's lab](https://semoconlab.com/). I received my Master's degrees from SUNY Optometry and SeoulTech.
