My research investigates how the brain integrates sensory signals with motor actions to navigate a dynamic world. I use psychophysics, machine learning, and electroencephalography (EEG) to explore how environmental statistics and physical constraints shape our perception. My goal is to uncover the computational principles that enable the visual system to build robust spatiotemporal representations, ranging from stereoscopic depth to predictive motion processing.

I am a PhD candidate in Psychology at Northeastern University, working with [Peter Bex](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/peter-bex/). Previously, I worked as a post-master's researcher in Joonyeol Lee's lab. I received my Master's degrees from SUNY Optometry and SeoulTech.
